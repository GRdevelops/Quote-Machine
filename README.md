# React Quote Machine

This is a React-based quote generator that dynamically fetches and displays a diverse range of quotes from an external API. 
Each new quote triggers a fresh change in the app's background and icon colors. 
Building this as my third coding project, I honed my foundational skills in React and API integration.

## Deployment
This project was deployed using Netlify: https://quote-generator-using-react.netlify.app/
