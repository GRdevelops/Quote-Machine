# React Quote Machine

## Introduction
This is a React-based Quote Machine project, part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in React and front-end development. 

The application dynamically displays quotes and allows users to generate new quotes and share them on social media.

## Deployment
This project was deployed using Netlify: https://quote-generator-using-react.netlify.app/

## Features
- **Random Quote Generation**: Click a button to display a new, randomly selected quote fetched from an API (https://api.quotable.io/random).
- **Dinamic background color**: Colors change at every quote and are randomly selected from a pull of colors, you can't get the same color twice in a row.
- **Social Media Sharing**: Easily share quotes on Twitter/X.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling components.
- **APIs**: Fetch quotes from an external API.

## Project Structure
- `src/`
  - `components/`: Contains all React components.

  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
- `public/`
